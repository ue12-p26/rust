# Porting notes

This file tracks how the MyST port in `with-myst/` differs from the upstream
LaTeX source, and records the reference commit we forked from.

When upstream changes, the plan is to `git diff <ref>..HEAD -- foo.tex` per
file (the file-name correspondence is 1:1) and port the delta into the
matching `.md`. The entries below flag the regions where a naïve overwrite
would lose a deliberate local choice.

## Status

Porting paused at the end of **Part 2 (*Basics*)** — i.e. through chapter 8
*Functions — Part I* inclusive. Chapters covered:

- Part 1 (*Preliminaries*): 1 *Introduction*, 2 *Environment*
- Part 2 (*Basics*): 3 *Variables & constants*, 4 *Atomic types*,
  5 *Memory — Part I*, 6 *Complex types*, 7 *Syntax & control flow*,
  8 *Functions — Part I*

Chapters 9+ (*Fundamentals*, *Proficiency*, *Expertise*, *Mastery*,
*Appendices*) are not yet ported.

## Upstream reference

This porting wave was made against:

```
upstream: git@gitlab.com:cnrgh/teaching/rust-class.git
commit:   a23b9f88719067bc26ce7b57ccc0192bd979ba4b
subject:  Resolve "Change admonition colors"
date:     2026-05-12
```

When resuming, fetch upstream and use
`git -C <repo> diff a23b9f88..<new-ref> -- <foo>.tex` per file to identify
the deltas to port into the matching `<foo>.md`.

## Local divergences from upstream

### 1. `.bss` example wrapped in a function (`memory.md`)

Upstream LaTeX:

```rust
static mut N: usize = 0;
static mut BUFFER: [u8; 16] = [0; 16];

#[allow(static_mut_refs)]
unsafe {
  N = 10;
  // ...
  println!("BUFFER={BUFFER:?}");
}
```

MyST port:

```rust
static mut N: usize = 0;
static mut BUFFER: [u8; 16] = [0; 16];

#[allow(static_mut_refs)]
fn fill_and_print() {
  unsafe {
    N = 10;
    // ...
    println!("BUFFER={BUFFER:?}");
  }
}

fill_and_print();
```

**Why:** `#[allow(...)]` (or `#![allow(...)]`) on an `unsafe { ... }` block
is an attribute on a *block expression*, which is gated by the unstable
`stmt_expr_attributes` feature. The LaTeX build apparently wraps each
snippet in a way that accepts the experimental form (or compiles with the
feature enabled); evcxr's cell-wrapping does not. Item-level attributes (on
`fn`, `struct`, `mod`, ...) are stable, so we wrap the body in a function
and put `#[allow(static_mut_refs)]` on the function instead.

**Semantically equivalent.** The `.bss` demonstration is unchanged: same
two `static mut` declarations, same writes, same prints, same lint
suppression.

**Status:** the LaTeX source also fails to run in some environments
(reported upstream). If upstream adopts a similar workaround, we may be
able to converge.

### 2. `:::{important}` → `:::{warning}`

We use `:::{warning}` everywhere the LaTeX has `\begin{important}{...}`,
because MyST's default `book-theme` renders both `note` and `important`
with the same blue chrome. `warning` gives us a visually distinct second
admonition style (orange/amber), matching the LaTeX original's intent of
having `note` and `important` look different.

**On merge:** if upstream adds new `\begin{important}{...}` blocks, port
them as `:::{warning}` (not `:::{important}`).

### 3. `[disable]` cells → plain fenced code blocks

LaTeX's `\begin{minted}[disable]{...}` means "render but don't execute".
The MyST equivalent of a non-executable code block is a plain fenced code
block (no `{code-cell}` directive). Pages affected:

- `env_install.md` — `rustup default stable`
- `env_cargo.md` — `cargo --list`, `cargo install bat`,
  `cargo run --bin foo2 -- arg1 ...`, the two `cargo add` examples in
  admonitions
- `resources.md` — `cargo install rustlings` block
- `var_scope.md` — the `{ let x = 1; }` scope demo
- `comments.md` — all examples
- `loop.md` — the infinite-loop example

**On merge:** treat new `[disable]` cells the same way (plain fences).

### 4. Stack-overflow demo in `memory.md`

The 1-billion-element array `let array = [123; 1_000_000_000];` is rendered
as a *plain* (non-executable) rust fence with a one-line note. The LaTeX
version executes it; in evcxr that would SIGSEGV the kernel and break the
rest of the page. `:tags: [raises-exception]` doesn't help because a
native stack overflow is a kernel death, not a recoverable error.

### 5. Cross-references to appendix tables — dropped

`\autoref{table:ArithOp}` / `\ref{tab:CargoSubCmds}` / etc. were removed
from `env_cargo.md`, `int.md`, `float.md`, `bool.md`, `array.md`. The
appendix chapters (`cargo_cmds`, `rust_apps`, `*_methods`, etc.) are not
yet ported.

In-file table refs (`\autoref{table:CharEsc}` in `char.tex`,
`\autoref{tab:RangeSyntax}` in `ranges.tex`) **were** kept and converted to
MyST `{numref}` against `{list-table}` blocks in the same file.

### 6. Bibliography citations — inlined

`\cite{...}` was replaced with inline hyperlinks to the referenced URL
(e.g. `[Perkel 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03382-2)`).
`refs.bib` is not currently consumed by MyST.

**On merge:** new `\cite{Foo}` references need the matching `@Foo` entry
from `refs.bib` looked up by hand and inlined.

### 7. Side-by-side figures — currently stacked

In `memory.tex`, `call_stack.png` and `memory_heap.png` are placed
side-by-side using LaTeX `minipage`s. In the MyST port they are stacked
vertically. The cleanest MyST equivalent is a `::::{grid} 2` wrapper with
two `:::{figure}` children — to be applied when we revisit `memory.md`.

### 8. `\paragraph{}` → `###` heading

In `env_cargo.md`, the LaTeX `\paragraph{Creating a new project from
scratch}` and `\paragraph{It is also possible to initialize a project
inside a Git repository}` became `### Creating a new project from scratch`
and `### Initializing a project inside a Git repository`. This gives them
visible structure in the sidebar instead of inline bold.

### 9. Exercise admonition (`fct_main.md`)

LaTeX `\begin{exercise}{First program} ... \end{exercise}` rendered as
`:::{admonition} Exercise — First program / :class: tip`. The
`\autoref{sol:FirstProg}` solution pointer was dropped (solutions chapter
not yet ported).

### 10. LaTeX text macros → plain text

`\rust`, `\C`, `\cpp`, `\python`, `\R`, `\rustc`, `\cargo`, `\nix`,
`\unix`, `\windows`, `\macos`, `\linux`, `\homebrew`, `\GIL`, `\GC`, etc.
are all spelled out as plain text in the MyST port (Rust, C, C++, Python,
R, rustc, cargo, ...). Pervasive; no per-occurrence action needed on
merge — just spell things out.

### 11. Image paths

LaTeX `\IncImg{...}` resolves paths relative to the repo root.
MyST sees paths relative to each `.md` file, so all image references in
the port use `../img/...`, `../gen_img/...` or `../common/...`. The
`\CeaLogo` macro was resolved to its target file (`common/cea_logo.png`).

**On merge:** new figures need their paths rewritten with the `../`
prefix and pointed at the same source assets.
